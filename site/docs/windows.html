<h1>Windows support</h1>
<p>
  Currently, Buster does not work fully on Windows. This page contains known
  issues, the status of various modules, and a todo list. If you're a
  Windows developer that would like to use Buster, your help is very much
  appreciated.
</p>
<h2>Running tests on Windows</h2>
<p>
  To fix most of these problems, you will need to run buster's tests. Because
  of some these problems, you cannot use the <code>buster test</code> CLI tool
  at this point. Instead, simply run individual test files with the
  <code>node</code> binary, i.e., <code>node test/posix-argv-parser-test.js</code>.
</p>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Binary dependencies</li>
  <li>Failing tests (on Windows) in certain modules</li>
  <li>
    Wide-spread use of string concatenation for paths, rather than the
    appropriate (and platform-independent) <code>path.join()</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Binary dependencies</h2>
<p>
  Buster depends on a few modules that have binary extension dependencies. These
  do not build on Windows (and never will), thus we need to find a way around
  them. To my knowledge there are two main problems: Faye 0.7 (which depends on
  redis, which needs to be compiled) and jsdom, which depends on Contextify.
  Contextify is possible to set up for Windows with pre-built binaries, but not
  with NPM.
</p>
<p>
  The Faye issue is being solved in
  August's <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-capture-server/tree/0.5.0">rewrite
  of buster-capture-server</a>, which depends on Faye 0.8, which does not have the
  redis dependency.
</p>
<p>
  The jsdom issue is still unsolved. jsdom is an optional dependency for Buster,
  so we really should be able to install on Windows even if we can't get jsdom.
  Help is appreciated.
</p>
<h2>Failing tests</h2>
<p>
  Some modules have failing tests on Windows. You can help by
  <a href="/docs/developers/">setting up the development environment</a>, and
  run the tests for either of these projects, and fix the failing ones.
</p>
<p>
  In many cases, tests fail because of inappropriate string concatenation when
  dealing with paths (see the next section).
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/busterjs/posix-argv-parser">posix-argv-parser</a> 1 failing test, also fails on Linux...</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-bayeux-emitter">buster-bayeux-emitter</a> Tests depend on Faye, so will not run.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-capture-server">buster-capture-server</a> August is on the case</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-cli">buster-cli</a> 3 errors, hangs</li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-syntax">buster-syntax</a> A few failing tests, due to missing jsdom dependency. Actually OK</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-test-cli">buster-test-cli</a> Some failing tests, possibly path related</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inappropriate path concatenation</h2>
<p>
  Buster uses string concatenation to build paths in many places. This causes
  paths with forward slashes on Windows, which does not work. To find and fix
  these, running the tests should mostly help. If you find somewhere that uses
  string concatenation where <code>path.join()</code> should have been used and
  this is not caught by the tests, please help by adding tests and fixing the
  problem.
