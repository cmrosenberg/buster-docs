<h1>Buster.JS Architecture overview</h1>
<p>
  Buster.JS consists of many small Git repositories/NPM modules. We try to keep
  things small and separated. The repositories and installable modules both
  promotes reusability (e.g. you can use
  <a href="http://cjohansen.no/using-buster-assertions-with-jstestdriver">Buster
  assertions with any test framework</a>) and helps us avoid tight coupling
  between modules. However, some people feel that the number of repositories are
  a bit daunting when trying to contribute. This document sheds some light on
  existing modules, what they're for, and what role they play in the bigger
  part.
</p>
<p>
  Note that some of our modules contain stronger abstractions than others, and
  the less obvious ones may very well change until we have something that we're
  comfortable with. If you have suggestions for how certain modules can improve
  (renaming/merging/splitting/refactoring/whatever),
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/busterjs-dev">feel free to let us
  know</a>.
</p>
<h2>Buster.JS core modules</h2>
<p>
  Core modules are those that are installed when you type
  <code>npm install buster</code>. They constitute the core of the test
  framework, and contains everything you need to run node tests, simple browser
  tests and automated crowd-sourced browser tests.

</p>
<h2 id="user-agent-parser">buster-user-agent-parser</h2>
<p>
  A generic user-agent parser that does a best-effort attempt at extracting
  browser, version and platform. Only used for "friendly" browser names in
  test result reports, list of slaves and so on.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable (new UA's occasionally added)</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-user-agent-parser">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="terminal">buster-terminal</h2>
<p>
  A small library for working with
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">ANSI escape
  sequences</a> in the terminal. Mostly used for colored output, and positional
  output. Also includes a "labeled list" object that is used to progressively
  print multiple lines of output at once, e.g. when running tests on multiple
  browsers (the dots reporter).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable, mostly complete</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-terminal">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analyzer">buster-analyzer</h2>
<p>
  A simple and generic mechanism for flagging warnings. The analyzer is an event
  emitter, and provides <code>fatal</code>, <code>error</code> and
  <code>warning</code> methods, which emit corresponding events. Additionally,
  the analyzer has a concept of ok/not ok. This is decided from a threshold
  (i.e., a threshold of "error" means "not ok" if any error or fatal events where
  flagged).
</p>
<p>
  The analyzer also comes with a reporter which can be used to log events of
  interest. The analyzer and the reporter is used by
  <a href="#test-cli">buster-test-cli</a> and extensions to provide various
  insight about your code. Examples of practical usage includes linting and
  syntax checking (for browser tests).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: In development, may change significantly</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-analyzer">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="syntax">buster-syntax</h2>
<p>
  A small extension that provides server-side syntax checking of scripts
  sent for testing with buster-capture-server. When Buster.JS loads scripts in
  browsers, the browser in question will be the one responsible for the level
  of detail when errors arise, Syntax checking on the server allows us to catch
  these errors in one place, and produce a pretty nice report, regardless of
  browser intended to run the tests.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable, but integrates with <code>buster-analyzer</code>, which is not</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-analyzer">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="core">buster-core</h2>
<p>
  Somewhat arbitrary collection of functions used in several other buster
  modules. Includes the event emitter implementation used throughout, some
  limited flow-control utilities, and a few functional enhancements. Hopefully,
  we can get rid of this one day.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-core">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assertions">buster-assertions</h2>
<p>
  Assertions and expectations, for Buster.JS and everyone else.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable, awaiting a few additions before 1.0</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-assertions">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="format">buster-format</h2>
<p>
  ASCII formatting of arbitrary JavaScript objects. This module is used to give
  pretty feedback in certain cases. It is used to format objects in assertion
  error messages, to format objects passed to <code>buster.log</code>
  (and <code>console.log</code>, if captured) and may be usde in more places
  later. Also intended for reuse outside of the Buster.JS sphere.

  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-format">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="evented-logger">buster-evented-logger</h2>
<p>
  A logger-like utility that simply emits events. This is useful in any number
  of cases, most importantly when running tests in browsers via
  buster-capture-server. In this case, we pass the events over the wire instead
  of printing them to the console.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-evented-logger">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="test">buster-test</h2>
<p>
  Implements <code>testCase</code>, <code>describe</code> (and friends), the
  actual test runner, reporters and supporting objects. <code>buster-test</code>
  is centered around the concept of "test contexts", which is just a bag of
  tests, and possibly more bags of tests. This is the shared data format
  produced by both the xUnit and BDD style tests/specs.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: May be split into several modules and/or renamed.</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-test">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  The reason we're considering breaking up this module is that it includes parts
  that are complete and unlikely to change (such as test case and spec
  definitions, the context data format and the test runner) <strong>and</strong>
  parts that are likely to change and/or have abilities added, such as
  reporters. The name also indicates it is what powers the
  <code>buster-test</code> binary, which is not true.
</p>
<h2 id="sinon">buster-sinon</h2>
<p>
  Integrating Sinon.JS with buster. Adds Sinon-specific assertions, wires up
  Sinon.JS to use <code>buster-format</code> for error messages, adds automatic
  sandboxing/restoration of fakes for test cases and so on.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-sinon">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources">buster-resources</h2>
<p>
  Represents files in a project that may be included in a test run. For node,
  Buster.JS only uses resources to look up which paths to <code>require</code>.
  For browsers, Buster.JS uses <code>buster-resources</code> to build a virtual
  file system, send it over HTTP and mount it on the server. All of these
  components are available in this module.
</p>
<p>
  <code>buster-resources</code> also includes intelligent caching of resources
  to allow test runs that only reads changed tests from file and so on.
  Resources typically map to files on disk, but really can be anything,
  including one-off strings in a configuration file.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable, has a few known issues waiting to be fixed</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-resources">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capture-server">buster-capture-server</h2>
<p>
  The capture server captures browsers as slaves, and offers a completely
  generic API for carrying out work across those slaves. A workload is known as
  a "session", and a test run is typically a session. Other uses include for
  instance synced-across-devices slide shows (for which a POC has been built).
</p>
<p>
  In general, the server knows nothing specifically of testing. It knows how
  to accept and server resource sets, capture and command browser slaves, and
  coordinate every piece using messaging (Bayeux on the HTTP level).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Unstable, currently undergoing API changes</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-capture-server">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bayeux-emitter">buster-bayeux-emitter</h2>
<p>
  Given <code>subscribe</code> and <code>publish</code> methods, this module
  produces an object that looks and behaves like an event emitter (i.e. no
  specific requirements on event names and so on).
</p>
<p>
  Specifically, the bayeux emitter is used to allow the test runner in the
  browser (via buster-capture-server) ship its progress events directly over
  the wire (which is a Bayeux wire).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-bayeux-emitter">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuration">buster-configuration</h2>
<p>
  Programmatic access to <code>buster.js</code> configuration files. Allows
  you to extract resourceSets (i.e. all the file names/contents), environment
  options, run extension hooks and filter out groups.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable. Occasionally learns about new properties.</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-configuration">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="client">buster-client</h2>
<p>
  <em>To be merged into buster-capture-server</em>. Implements a simple HTTP
  client for buster-capture-server's HTTP API. Is used by buster-test-cli to
  configure and create a session (remember, a generic work load, typically a
  test run).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Unstable, about to be merged into buster-capture-server</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-client">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="args">posix-argv-parser</h2>
<p>
  General-purpose command line argument parser. Only parses command line
  options, no printing to the console, no --help generation, no flow control.
  Also tries as best it can to adhere to UNIX conventions. Fails early
  (typically when using non-existent options ++).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable, has a few known (API design) issues waiting to be fixed</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/posix-argv-parser">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stream-logger">stream-logger</h2>
<p>
  Accepts a standard and error output stream, and returns a
  buster-evented-logger object that will print certains events directly to
  the passed-in stdout, and certain errors to stderr.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/stream-logger">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cli">buster-cli</h2>
<p>
  Somewhat arbitrary collection of utilities useful to CLIs that aim to behave
  more or less like existing Buster.JS CLIs. Is used by buster-test-cli and
  buster-static.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-cli">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="test-cli">buster-test-cli</h2>
<p>
  "The kitchen sink" behind <code>buster test</code>. Coordinates many other
  modules to read configuration file, loop all matching groups, creating runners
  and running those groups. In charge of options passed to <code>buster test</code>,
  colored printing and so on.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: In development</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-test-cli">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  This module is mostly stable, but is rapidly gaining features and extension
  points. My gut feeling tells me that this module houses too many things, and
  it will likely be broken up before we go 1.0.
</p>
<h2 id="static">buster-static</h2>
<p>
  A small and (currently, too) simple/limited way of easily running tests
  directly in a browser (i.e. without buster-server). Builds scaffolding markup
  and serves tests on a simple server.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Largely incomplete</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-static">Source code</a></li>

  dependencies. Includes some very rudimentary wiring across
  Buster-repositories.

<h2 id="jstestdriver">buster-jstestdriver</h2>
<p>
  An extension that allows Buster.JS to run JsTestDriver test suites, given
  a configuration file Buster.JS understands.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable, but lacks async test cases</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-jstestdriver">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="html-doc">buster-html-doc</h2>
<p>
  An extension that implements "markup-in-comments", using the
  <code>/*:DOC el = ... */</code> format originally found in JsTestDriver.
  The extension was originally developed to be API compatible with JsTestDriver
  in the <code>buster-jstestdriver</code> extension, but works well with
  vanilla Buster.JS test cases (and specs) too.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable</li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/busterjs/buster-html-doc">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lint">buster-lint</h2>
<p>
  Extension that enables the integration of JsLint and JsHint by way of
  <a href="https://github.com/magnars/autolint">autolint</a>. Using the
  <code>buster-analyzer</code> module, the lint extension is able to flag
  lint errors as "error" in buster. This allows the end-user to choose if
  lint errors should only be printed as warnings, or actually fail the build
  (which can be achieved with <code>buster test -F error</code>). Currently
  developed by
  <a href="https://github.com/magnars/buster-lint">Magnar Sveen</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable, but relies on buster-analyzer, which is not</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="amd">buster-amd</h2>
<p>
  <em>Work in progress</em>. Extension that will allow AMD projects to use
  Buster.JS without any specific configuration. It modifies the load path
  of the <code>resourceSet</code> used to represent user files and creates
  an anonymous AMD module that depends on all tests, thus loading files
  using an AMD loader rather than simple script tags. Currently developed
  by <a href="https://github.com/johlrogge/buster-amd">Joakim Ohlrogge</a>.

<h2 id="coverage">buster-coverage</h2>
<p>
  <em>Work in progress</em>. Extension to calculate line coverage. Uses
  the <code>resourceSet</code> to instrument code, and emits custom messages
  over the test runner to build up the report. Currently developed by
  <a href="https://github.com/ebi/coverage-helpers">Tobias Ebn&ouml;ther</a>.

<h2 id="coffee">buster-coffee</h2>
<p>
  Extension that automatically compile CoffeeScript files before running
  tests. In its current state, this extension does not work for files that are
  to be included using <code>require()</code>, and is thus not very useful for
  Node.js projects. Currently developed
  by <a href="https://github.com/jodal/buster-coffee">Stein Magnus Jodal</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status: Stable, but future changes may be required to support Node.js and
  <code>require()</code></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jodal/buster-coffee">Source code</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-browser">By example: <code>buster test --browser</code></h2>
<p>
  This section runs through what happens when you automate browser tests from
  the command line, e.g. when you type something like
  <kbd>buster test --browser</kbd>. The idea is to highlight roughly the flow
  through the various parts of Buster, and to illustrate practically how the
  modules depend on and interact with each other.
</p>
<p>
  In this section, files are referred to as <code>package/path/to/file</code>,
  meaning that "buster/lib/buster/buster-wiring.js" refers to the file
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/blob/master/lib/buster/buster-wiring.js">lib/buster/buster-wiring.js</a>
  in the <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster">buster</a> package.
</p>
<h3>The binary</h3>
<p>
  <kbd>buster test</kbd> executes the "binary" script
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/blob/master/bin/buster">buster/bin/buster</a>.
  This is a small wrapper script that can print some help, and that can look for
  other commands on the path called <code>buster-<em>something</em></code>. In
  this case, it finds the
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/blob/master/bin/buster-test">buster/bin/buster-test</a>
  script in the same package. The <code>buster</code> package is a "meta package",
  meaning that it does not contain much implementation, it's just there to glue
  all the pieces together and give you a convenient install target.
</p>
<h3>Command line options</h3>
<p>
  The <code>buster-test</code> "binary" simply delegates to
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-test-cli/blob/master/lib/buster-test-cli/cli/test.js">buster-test-cli/lib/buster-test-cli/cli/test.js</a>,
  which defines the CLI interface for running tests. Command line options are
  handled by <code>posix-argv-parser</code>, and to some
  extend, <code>buster-cli</code>.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-cli/blob/master/lib/buster-cli.js">buster-cli</a>
  is not so much a real abstraction, as it is a collection of routines useful in
  buster CLIs. It centralizes help text formatting, provides helpers for adding
  CLI options with help text, locates the configuration file and coordinates
  loading it with running.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>--browser</code> option is a posix-argv-parser shorthand that
  expands to <code>--environment browser</code>, which is the long form for
  specifying environment.
</p>
<h3>Loading configuration</h3>
<p>
  The configuration file is located and "resolved" in
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-cli/blob/master/lib/buster-cli.js">buster-cli/lib/buster-cli.js</a>.
  It tries to find the configuration file in one of <code>./</code>,
  <code>./test/</code> or <code>./spec/</code>. If it is not found, the parent
  directory will be consulted in the same way until we're at the root.
</p>
<p>
  If the <code>--config</code> option was provided, only that file will be
  consulted. <code>buster-cli</code> contains some error handling in case
  configuration could not be located.
</p>
<p>
  For loading the contents of the configuration file into memory, a separate
  package,
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-configuration">buster-configuration</a>
  is used. Buster.JS defers actually reading source files from disks as long as
  possible, so "resolving" the configuration file only loads relevant groups
  with their extensions and builds lazy
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-resources/blob/master/lib/resource-set.js">resource
  sets</a> to represent files. <code>buster-cli</code> uses several options to
  filter out the groups found in the configuration file to figure out which ones
  will eventually be run.
</p>
<h3>Detour: Extension hooks</h3>
<p>
  A configuration group has a method called <code>runExtensionHook</code>.
  You call this method with the name of a hook and some arguments. Any extension
  in the configuration that has a method of the same name will then be called
  with the passed in arguments.
</p>
<h3>Loading the browser runner</h3>
<p>
  Depending on what groups resulted from reading the configuration file and
  filtering it according to command line options, the following steps may be
  repeated several times. For simplicity, this example assumes only one
  configuration was loaded.
</p>
<p>
  Now that <code>buster-test-cli</code> knows that we're running tests for the
  browser environment, it loads
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-test-cli/blob/master/lib/buster-test-cli/cli/runners/browser-runner.js">the
  browser runner</a>. The runner will have its <code>run</code> method called
  with the configuration loaded from file, an options object, which contains
  prepared options for things like color etc, and a callback that will be called
  when the run is over.
</p>
<p>
  The runner now uses a little abstraction that is shared between the browser and
  the node runner. It creates an
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-analyzer/blob/master/lib/analyzer.js">analyzer</a>
  for general-purpose health-checks, and fires the <code>"beforeRun"</code>
  extension hook, allowing extensions to register analyzers.
</p>
<p>
  The browser runner then proceeds to instantiate a
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-client/blob/master/lib/client.js">buster-client/lib/client.js</a>.
  This object is a JavaScript interface that speaks HTTP to a running buster
  server. Because the server component is currently being reworked, this
  document will only briefly touch on the concepts it implements.
</p>
<h3>The server: A brief overview</h3>
<p>
  The server has the ability to capture browsers as slaves. A slave is a browser
  that has loaded a frameset, where one frame, "the control frame", keeps a
  persitent connection to the server, awaiting instructions. The server also
  provides an HTTP API for creating a session - a piece of work to be carried
  out in available slaves. When this happens, the server uses the bidirectional
  connection to instruct slaves to load the session in a separate frame.
</p>
<p>
  When loading a session in a browser, an index.html file is loaded in a
  separate frame, and this file will include <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags
  that loads all the files originally specified in the configuration under
  <code>libs</code>, <code>sources</code>, <code>testHelpers</code> and
  <code>tests</code>.
</p>
<h3>The browser-part of the server</h3>
<p>
  Alongside the sources, a little
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-test-cli/blob/master/lib/buster-test-cli/browser/wiring.js">wiring script</a>
  is loaded. This file configures a listener for new
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-test/blob/master/lib/buster-test/test-case.js">test cases</a>
  and
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-test/blob/master/lib/buster-test/spec.js">specs</a>.
  Finally it wires up a
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-test/blob/master/lib/buster-test/test-runner.js">test runner</a>
  with a
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-test/blob/master/lib/buster-test/reporters/json-proxy.js">JSON
  proxy reporter</a> and defines <code>buster.run()</code> as a way to start the
  whole thing. The test runner is completely evented, and the JSON proxy
  reporter is just a way of making sure the events are only data, thus
  HTTP-encodable. The events from the test runner are sent directly over the wire.
</p>
<h3>Back on the client</h3>
<p>
  Back on the client, <code>buster-test-cli</code> is now ready to use its HTTP
  client to create a session. The client starts by asking the server for
  available cache manifests. These will be handed to the <code>resourceSet</code>,
  and will make sure Buster does not read any files from disk that are already
  hosted in the same version on the server.
</p>
<p>
  Any file that isn't already cached will now be "serialized" (i.e. read from
  disk) and sent to the server as part of the HTTP POST request to create a
  session. The server uses a
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-resources/blob/master/lib/resource-set-cache.js">resource set cache</a>
  to cache and look up cached resources, and a
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-resources/blob/master/lib/resource-middleware.js">resource set middleware</a>
  to actually serve them over HTTP.
</p>
<p>
  With the session readily created, <code>buster-test-cli</code>'s browser
  runner is listening for messages. These messages are piped into its
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-test-cli/blob/master/lib/buster-test-cli/test-runner/remote-runner.js">remote
  runner</a>. This object accepts messages from multiple test runners (i.e. one
  per browser), and emits messages as if it was one test runner. The originating
  browser is represented as an outer context for all tests. This allows the
  "remote runner" to be used directly with any existing reporter written for
  the regular test runner.
</p>
<h3>The "testRun" extension hook</h3>
<p>
  After the remote runner has been initialized, but before the tests are
  actually started, the client issues the <code>"testRun"</code> extension hook,
  which allows extensions to interact with the test runner (e.g. to listen to
  specific messages etc).
</p>
<h3>Finishing up</h3>
<p>
  When the session is created and the remote runner is initialized, the browser
  runner will listen for the test runner's <code>"suite:end"</code> event. This
  event comes with a short summary, which is passed to the browser runner's
  <code>done</code> callback (passed to <code>run</code>).
</p>
<p>
  The <code>test.js</code> CLI interface will now use the test report to decide
  if the run was successful or not and exit with a corresponding exit code. In
  the case where there are more configuration groups to be run, these will be
  run before exiting.
</p>
<h2>In summary</h2>
<p>
  This is of course a brief and incomplete overview, but it should provide some
  insight into how some of the more important parts work together.
