<h2>Setting up a development environment</h2>

<h3>First time setup</h3>

<p>
  If you don't already have <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> installed, install it on your system. 
  The same goes for <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>.
  For Windows we recommend <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/detail?name=Git-1.7.6-preview20110708.exe&can=2&q=%22Full+installer+for+official+Git+for+Windows%22">mysysgit</a>
  and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit">TortoiseGit</a>.
</p>

<p>The development environment is managed with a CLI, buster-dev-tools. To bootstrap, you create a folder of your choice - e.g. <kbd>myBusterDevEnv</kbd> - to hold 
all the packages, and inside get a clone of buster-dev-tools from github:</p>

<div class="input">
mkdir <kbd>myBusterDevEnv</kbd>
cd myBusterDevEnv
git clone https://github.com/busterjs/buster-dev-tools.git
</div>


<p>Now you need to set some environment variables. <tt>{path to devEnv}</tt> is the absolute path to the folder where you just ran <kbd>git clone</kbd>.</p>

<div class="input unix">
NODE_PATH=<kbd>{path to devEnv}</kbd>
PATH=$NODE_PATH/buster-dev-tools/bin:$PATH
PATH=$NODE_PATH/buster/bin:$PATH
</div>

<div class="input windows">
SET NODE_PATH=<kbd>{path to devEnv}</kbd>
SET PATH=%NODE_PATH%\buster-dev-tools\bin;%PATH%
SET PATH=%NODE_PATH%\buster\bin;%PATH%
</div>

<p class="clear">Now you run the tool to get all the buster packages plus external dependencies:</p>

<div class="input">
buster-dev-tools pull
</div>


<h3>Refreshing all repositories</h3>

<p>After some time you might want to update all the repos, including buster-dev-tools itself. To do so, simply repeat the <kbd>pull</kbd> command above.</p>


<h3>Migrating from an older dev-env</h3>
<p>
Previously, buster-dev-tools was also available as an npm package. This is not any longer supported. 
If you've been using this, make sure to first uninstall it:
</p>

<div class="input">
npm uninstall -g buster-dev-tools
</div>

<p>Then do a first time setup as above.</p>



<h2 id="docs">Running the documentation server</h2>

<p>
  To contribute docs, you will need to run the very simple docs server from module buster-docs.
  To edit docs, you only need to know HTML.
</p>

<p>You can do this either in a complete development environment as above or you can get buster-docs alone:</p>

<div class="input">
git clone https://github.com/busterjs/buster-docs.git
cd buster-docs
npm install
</div>

<p>Run the server:</p>

<div class="input">
cd buster-docs
node bin/server
</div>

<p>
  Now you can visit the docs on <a href="http://localhost:8090/">http://localhost:8090/</a>.
  The docs server simply combines docs pages with the <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-docs/blob/master/layout.html">layout file</a>.
</p>
<p>
  URL mapping is very simple. Anything in <code>site/*.html</code> is available
  over the server as http://localhost:8090/*/. For instance, this page, whose
  (relative) URL is <a href="/docs/developers/">/docs/developers/</a> is
  generated from the file <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-docs/blob/master/site/docs/developers.html">site/docs/developers.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You can make a static version of the site by running
  <code>node bin/build</code> (requires a running docs server).
</p>

<h2>Contribution guidelines</h2>

<p class="warning">Note: this section is work-in-progress</p>

<h3>Post questions to the busterjs-dev mailing list</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/busterjs-dev">busterjs-dev mailing list</a> is a place for general discussion regarding development of Buster.JS. In many cases you can just post an issue to <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues">the issue tracker</a> and the discussion can happen there. But you can also discuss on the mailing list if you're more comfortable with that. For example, you might prefer to use e-mail for discussion, or you want to discuss your contribution before posting it to the issue tracker.</p>

<h3>Coding style</h3>

<p>We don't have one yet :)</p>

<p>For now, look at some existing code to get an idea of what our code looks like.</p>
