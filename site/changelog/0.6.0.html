<h1>Buster.JS 0.6 - Beta 4</h1>

<p>
  Beta 4 packs a lot of changes, increased stability and new features. Tests
  written for older versions do not need any syntactical updates, while
  extensions and other "general API consumers" <em>may</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Documentation is currently lacking. There will be a documentation sprint prior
  to 1.0, but probably not before the next beta. For planned progress, refer to
  <a href="/roadmap.html">the roadmap</a>.
</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<p>
  This is a list of breaking changes in this release. Since we haven't reached
  1.0 stable yet, we're taking the freedom to change APIs without making them
  backwards compatible in the hope of making them better. There are a few more
  breaking changes planned for the next (last) beta, see
  <a href="/roadmap/">the roadmap</a>.
</p>

<h3>Naming changes</h3>

<p>
  In an effort to improve navigation in the many Buster.JS modules, we have
  started renaming some of them, as discussed <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/busterjs-dev/browse_thread/thread/454146b98e69eef9">on the mailing list</a>.
  These naming changes will only affect you if you are depending on either of
  these modules in your own projects.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>buster-resources is now <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/ramp-resources">ramp-resources</a> (the capture server will eventually become "ramp")</li>
  <li>buster-args is now <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/posix-argv-parser">posix-argv-parser</a></li>
  <li>buster-stdio-logger is now <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/stream-logger">stream-logger</a></li>
  <li>sinon-buster is now <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-sinon">buster-sinon</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Command line interface <kbd>buster-test</kbd></h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <kbd>--log-all</kbd> is gone. In Beta 3, Buster.JS would silence log
    messages for passing tests and this option would show all messages. In Beta
    4, Buster.JS shows all messages by default, and silences those from passing
    tests with <kbd>--quiet-log</kbd>.
  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Deprecated modules</h3>

<p>
  Some modules are no longer needed and will not receive further upgrades.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>buster-client</li>
  <li>buster-bayeux-emitter</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extension hooks</h3>

<p>
  Hooks fire in a given order. The <code>beforeRun</code> no longer comes with
  any arguments. To get a hold of the <code>analyzer</code>
  and <code>configuration</code> objects that used to be passed to it, implement
  <code>analyze(analyzer)</code> and <code>configure(configuration)</code>
  (called in that order) in addition.
</p>

<h2>New features</h2>

<p>
  The main theme of this release is a rewritten and vastly more stable capture
  server. Significant work has also been put into making it easy to use the
  server and the related command-line interfaces with any test framework (e.g.
  it should now be possible to use these tools to create a <kbd>qunit-test</kbd>
  binary that runs QUnit tests over the server).
</p>

<h3>Command-line interface <kbd>buster-test</kbd></h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <kbd>--full-stacks</kbd> disables the stack filter that's used to hide
    Buster.JS internals from stack traces.
  </li>
  <li>
    Implementation and API-wise, the <code>buster-test-cli</code> module is now
    completely test framework-agnostic. The framework sources are injected as
    an extension in the "binary" script that uses. In other words, the Buster.JS
    test framework is now just a regular extension to the Buster.JS CLI tools.
    For an example, see <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/blob/v0.6.0/bin/buster-test">buster-test</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Command-line interface <kbd>buster-server</kbd></h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/blob/v0.6.0/bin/buster-server">This CLI</a>
  is now backed by <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster-server-cli">a dedicated module</a>
  that supports skinning and customization.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <kbd>--full-stacks</kbd> disables the stack filter that's used to hide
    Buster.JS internals from stack traces.
  </li>
  <li>
    Implementation and API-wise, the <code>buster-test-cli</code> module is now
    completely test framework-agnostic. The framework sources are injected as
    an extension in the "binary" script that uses. In other words, the Buster.JS
    test framework is now just a regular extension to the Buster.JS CLI tools.
    For an example, see <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/blob/v0.6.0/bin/buster-test">buster-test</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>NPM test</h3>

<p>
  All modules now have a working <kbd>npm test</kbd>. All modules are also
  configured with continuous integration on Travis CI, but will need further
  love to make the setups work nicely on Travis (basically we have some ugly
  circular dependencies that needs to be done away with).
</p>

<h3>Analyzer improvements</h3>

<p>
  The analyzer is the object that is used for quality assurance metrics, such as
  the lint extension.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Errors can be objects with either a <code>content</code> or a
    <code>message</code> property for the error message. Support for
    <code>message</code> is new.
  </li>
  <li>
    In addition to "OK" and "failed", the analyzer can now have an "unclean"
    state, which means it's passing, but did receive non-fatal warnings or
    errors.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Autotest improvements</h3>

<p>
  The autotest module has seen significant improvements through Magnar Sveen's
  work on <a href="http://github.com/busterjs/fs-watch-tree">fs-watch-tree</a>.
  The autotest command-line interface itself also received some usability
  upgrades. Autotest should now work flawlessly on Linux and OSX (Windows
  unconfirmed at this point).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Re-run all tests by tapping Ctrl-C. Hit Ctrl-C twice to stop. Currently only
    works for <code>buster-autotest</code>, not <code>buster autotest</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Screen is cleared between each run.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Ramp resources improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Don't put duplicate objects in the cache</li>
  <li>
    Individual resources have cacheable: true|false. This means extensions can
    control cacheability (i.e. repeatability for warnings etc) on a very
    fine-grained level.
  </li>
  <li>
    Resource Etag changes when adding processors. Avoids caching issues: If an
    extension is added in a configuration file, the cache manifest would not
    update. With this change, any extension that adds processors will cause
    the cache manifest for affected resources to update, avoiding any stale
    cache lookups.
  </li>
  <li>Propagate resource content processor exceptions.</li>
  <li>
    Root resources can specify where to insert scripts by adding {{scripts}} to
    the template contents.
  </li>
  <li>Improve error message for missing paths.</li>
  <li>Path normalization now accounts for Windows paths.</li>
  <li>Only globbing once for appendLoad and prependLoad.</li>
</ul>

<h3>buster-test improvements (focus rocket!)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Focus rocket: Sort of the opposite of a deferred test. Prepend any test name
    with the focus rocket "=>" and only tests with the rocket will run. See
    <a href="http://ascii.io/a/548">this short screencast on it</a>.
  </li>
  <li>The dots reporter tracks elapsed time.</li>
  <li>
    <code>buster.testContext</code> is now an event emitter, and
    <code>buster.testContext.on("create", function () {});</code> takes over
    for <code>buster.testCase.onCreate(function () {});</code> and
    <code>buster.spec.onCreate(function () {});</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><kbd>~/.buster.js</kbd></h3>

<p>
  The buster.js configuration file you put in your projects has a strict focus
  on project-related settings. This means that it intentionally does not support
  personal preferences like <code>--color dim</code>. This is
  where <code>~/.buster.js</code> (or <code>~/.buster.d/index.js</code> if you
  prefer) enters. Currently the following settings can be provided:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>test.releaseConsole</code>. If <code>true</code>, never capture the
    console.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>test.quietLog</code>. If <code>true</code>, never print log messages
    for passing tests.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>test.color</code>. One of "dim", "bright" (default) or "none".
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  To specify preferences, <kbd>~/.buster.js</kbd> (or
  (<kbd>~/.buster.d/index.js</kbd>) should look like this:
</p>

<pre><code>module.exports = {
    "test.color": "dim"

    // More settings as needed
};</code></pre>

<h3>Partial Windows support</h3>

<p>
  <a href="/docs/windows/">Windows support</a> work is ongoing. In this version,
  Node tests with the <code>buster-test</code> command-line interface is
  working, while the server and browser automation part is still not quite
  there. If you need Windows support, please consider chipping in.
</p>

<h3>Argv parsing</h3>

<p>
  buster-args is now posix-argv-parser and has an overhauled API. Highlights:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for transforms</li>
  <li>Support for types</li>
  <li>New, close-to-stateless API</li>
</ul>

<h3>Various additions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>buster-core</strong> Event emitter: it is now safe to remove a
    listener inside a listener.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>buster-core</strong> Event emitter: It is now possible to subscribe
    to all events with one call, <code>obj.on(function (event, data) {});</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>buster-core</strong> Extracted tmpFile method from
    buster-configuration.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>buster-format</strong> Bug fix: hasOwnProperty issue on IE9.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>buster-lint</strong> Prevent caching of files containing lint.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>buster-sinon</strong> callOrder accepts array of spies.
  </li>

</ul>
