<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>
  This is a rough road map of how we imagine getting Buster.JS to a rock solid
  v1.0. When we slap Buster.JS with the big 'ole "1.0", we guarantee that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tests will not break (false positives/negatives, other breakage) when upgrading Buster.JS</li>
  <li>Extensions will not break from one release to another</li>
  <li>The APIs that make up Buster.JS will stay backwards-compatible</li>
  <li>The testing experience will be stable and fun</li>
  <li>Buster.JS works equally well on Linux, Windows and OSX</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Another goal of 1.0 is to have APIs that we feel gives us some room to "grow"
  new features in the future. Obviously, this is a "soft goal", and one that's
  hard to quantify, but it will at least account for some of the more lofty
  dreams we currently have.
</p>
<h2>When will you support Windows?</h2>
<p>
  Windows support is a requirement for us to tag Buster.JS with "1.0", but we
  haven't planned it in more detail than that. If you use Windows and want to
  help, refer to <a href="/docs/windows/">Windows support status</a>.
</p>
<h2><del>Buster.JS 0.6 (AKA Beta 4)</del></h2>
<p>
  Released June 20th, see <a href="/changelog/0.6.0/">the changelog</a>.
  <a href="/changelog/0.6.1/">0.6.1, 2012.07.09</a>
</p>
<h2>Buster.JS 0.7 (AKA Beta 5/RC 1)</h2>
<p>
  The final "big" changes will land. Bug fixes. New documentation site.
</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Naming changes. See <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/busterjs-dev/browse_thread/thread/454146b98e69eef9">this thread</a>, and
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/busterjs-dev/browse_thread/thread/8d1a1c15b9c559f4">this
    thread</a>. Most importantly, some generally useful modules gain fully
    stand-alone names (i.e. they'll drop the buster- prefix and/or change names
    altogether).
  </li>
  <li>
    Internal browser modules will use AMD to avoid leaking globals.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><del>buster-resources</del> <ins>ramp-resources</ins> API
    change</strong>. The proposed change gives resources the ability to have
    multiple representations, based on the desired content type. This will
    significantly up the game for extensions that make big changes to resources,
    such as compile-to languages and other pre-processors.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>buster-test</code> changes</strong>. Currently, every
    configuration group is run as isolated test runs, and the dots reporter has
    a very specific mode for the multi-browser runs. The proposed change fixes
    both of these by representing all configuration groups with a test runner.
    All of them will be coordinated by a master "multi runner", and this is
    where you plug in the reporters etc. This removes some duplication in the
    implementation, makes it possible to have e.g. one XML report for any number
    of buster.js configuration files, and makes environments a native part of
    the test runner/reporters.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>New documentation site</strong>.
    Work is being put into a new documentation site based on Sphinx. There are
    plans for API docs to be extracted from module Readme's and source code.
    The site is proposed to launch with Buster 0.7.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><del>buster-assertions</del> <ins>referee</ins> 1.0</strong>.
    There's currently a pending change for <code>assert.exception</code>.
    Additionally, referee's equals and match algorithms will be extracted into a
    separate module (that among others Sinon.JS will use).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>buster-node</strong>. A package that provides the full Buster.JS
    testing experience, but only for node. Main goal is to reduce dependency
    count for node-only projects.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>
  Not yet in progress. Expected to complete early July, but may delay into
  August due to vacations and so on. This page will be updated with todo
  items and individual progress when 0.6 is out.
</p>
<h2>Release candidates</h2>
<p>
  If necessary, we will fix bugs and iron out issues from 0.7 and release as
  successive RC's until things stableize. At this point, we expect roughly one
  RC per week/two weeks until we hit the sweet-spot, which is...
</p>
<h2>Buster.JS 1.0</h2>
<p>
  Buster.JS 1.0 will be released when 0.7 has been tested in the wild, any
  breaking bugs have been fixed, and all current extensions have been updated
  to accommodate for API changes etc. <code>buster-static</code> will likely
  not be included with 1.0, but installable as an add-on.
</p>
<h2>Buster.JS 1.1</h2>
<p>
  A revamped <code>buster-static</code> that can do both Node and Browser tests
  from within the browser is included in the default installation.
</p>
<p>
  Installers for OSX and Windows.
</p>
<p>
  <code>buster-ci</code> a new binary that can automate everything - start
  server, capture browsers, run tests, wind down. Headless testing.
