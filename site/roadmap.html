<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>
  This is a rough road map of how we imagine getting Buster.JS to a rock solid
  v1.0. When we slap Buster.JS with the big 'ole "1.0", we guarantee that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tests will not break (false positives/negatives, other breakage) when upgrading Buster.JS</li>
  <li>Extensions will not break from one release to another</li>
  <li>The APIs that make up Buster.JS will stay backwards-compatible</li>
  <li>The testing experience will be stable and fun</li>
  <li>Buster.JS works equally well on Linux, Windows and OSX</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Another goal of 1.0 is to have APIs that we feel gives us some room to "grow"
  new features in the future. Obviously, this is a "soft goal", and one that's
  hard to quantify, but it will at least account for some of the more lofty
  dreams we currently have.
</p>
<h2>When will you support Windows?</h2>
<p>
  Don't know. The issue is slowly being worked on, and it's a requirement for us
  to tag Buster.JS with "1.0". If you use Windows and want to see this happen,
  please consider helping. <a href="/docs/windows/">Windows support status</a>.
</p>
<h2>Buster.JS 0.6 (AKA Beta 4)</h2>
<p>
  Beta 4 is expected in early June 2012. It features several rewritten/reworked
  modules, deprecates some old ones, and should generally vastly improve the
  stability of browser tests. It will also improve browser support for older
  browsers.
</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>New <a href="/docs/capture-server/">capture-server</a>.</strong>
    A more stable implementation, better handling of connection edge-cases,
    better suited for older browsers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Revamped <code>buster-server</code> CLI</strong>.
    Mostly interesting for people looking to reuse Buster.JS' server components
    for other testing frameworks. The new implementation allows skinning and
    customization, and separates it from the implementation of other CLIs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Revamped <code>buster-test</code> CLI</strong>.
    Huge changes in APIs, focusing on reusability. The CLI is now completely
    generic, and does not come with any pre-existing knowledge about the
    Buster.JS testing framework. The specifics are injected at runtime, which
    means the <code>buster-test</code> "binary"/script. Some minor tweaks in
    user-facing behavior.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Status</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The browser-runner in the <code>buster-test</code> CLI is close to complete</li>
  <li>Some pending API additions in the capture server's client</li>
</ul>
<h2>Buster.JS 0.7 (AKA Beta 5/RC 1)</h2>
<p>
  The final two "big" changes will land. Bug fixes. New documentation site.
</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>buster-resources API change</strong>. The proposed change gives
    resources the ability to have multiple representations, based on the desired
    content type. This will significantly up the game for extensions that make
    big changes to resources, such as compile-to languages and other
    pre-processors.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>buster-test</code> changes</strong>. Currently, every
    configuration group is run as isolated test runs, and the dots reporter has
    a very specific mode for the multi-browser runs. The proposed change fixes
    both of these by representing all configuration groups with a test runner.
    All of them will be coordinated by a master "multi runner", and this is
    where you plug in the reporters etc. This removes some duplication in the
    implementation, makes it possible to have e.g. one XML report for any number
    of buster.js configuration files, and makes environments a native part of
    the test runner/reporters.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>New documentation site</strong>.
    Work is being put into a new documentation site based on Sphinx. There are
    plans for API docs to be extracted from module Readme's and source code.
    The site is proposed to launch with Buster 0.7.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>
  Not yet in progress. Expected to complete early July, but may delay into
  August due to vacations and so on. This page will be updated with todo
  items and individual progress when 0.6 is out.
</p>
<h2>Buster.JS 1.0</h2>
<p>
  Buster.JS 1.0 will be released when 0.7 has been tested in the wild, any
  breaking bugs have been fixed, and all current extensions have been updated
  to accommodate for API changes etc. <code>buster-static</code> will likely
  not be included with 1.0, but installable as an add-on.
</p>
<h2>Buster.JS 1.1</h2>
<p>
  A revamped <code>buster-static</code> that can do both Node and Browser tests
  from within the browser is included in the default installation. Installers
  for OSX and Windows.
